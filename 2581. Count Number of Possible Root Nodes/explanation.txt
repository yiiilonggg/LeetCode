original solution:
    brute force and treat each node as a new root and recount
    time: O(n^2)

however, we only need to check the changes when we take children of the roots as new roots
    reroot for each child of 0
    dfs at each child of 0
    when my dfs reaches a node, it is similar to being rerooted at that node
    since count of correct guesses is maintained at each iteration
