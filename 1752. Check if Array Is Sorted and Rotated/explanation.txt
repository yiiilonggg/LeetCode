naive solution

create a separate array to store the sorted order and compare
however, it takes O(n) space and sorting take O(nlogn) time

using pointers

traverse the array to find the start of the original array
    this can be done by checking if the current element is smaller than the previous
    if we have reached the end of the array, means the input array is already non-decreasing so return true
once we have the head of the original array, check if it is non-decreasing to the end of the array
    if there is a decreasing portion, return false
once at the end, check if the tail of the input array is not larger than the head of the input array
