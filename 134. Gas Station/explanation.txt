if total of cost > total of gas, no way that we can complete a circuit
if it is possible, there is a unique solution
traverse the gas and cost arrays, each time keeping track of the current sum of differences between gas and cost
if the current sum goes below zero, we set it to 0 and the start of the circuit to the next index
