fast algo to calculate large powers

consider a base, b, and an exponent, e, where we want to compute b ^ e
find the bit length of the exponent, and set a tracker (high) to 1 << (bitlength - 1)
set a res pointer and initialise it to have the value b
now we will run a for loop, while high > 0 and right-shifting one bit after every iteration
    at each iteration, res *= res
    if (high & e) != 0 (means e has a bit on the bit position high is pointing to)
        res *= b

computing time: O(log n)
