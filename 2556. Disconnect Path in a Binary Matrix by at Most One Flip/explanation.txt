1. dfs solution

perform dfs twice, each time only finding 1 unique path
if we can find 2 unique paths, return false
else true
** unique paths means nodes on each path are not overlapping

2. counting diagonals

adjust the grid such that all 1s represent paths from start to end (no deadends)
count the number of 1s on each diagonal
if any diagonal has less than 2 1s, means we can flip the node at that 1 to disconnect the graph
