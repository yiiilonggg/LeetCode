dp solution

keep 2 arrays
one keeps track of all 1s fliped to 0 (oneToZeros)
other keeps track of all 0s flipped to 1 (zeroToOnes)
at each index, the number of operations to make it a monotonic increasing string is oneToZeros[i + 1] + zeroToOnes[i] - 1
since at that index we either flip or not flip the bit

logic solution
keep track of the number of zeros and the number of ones you would flip to zeros
at each iteration, after updating zeros and oneToZeros, the number of zeros is the min of both variables
    if zeros > ones, then we should flip all ones we can consider all the bits as zeros, so its like we have restarted
