classical backtracking algorithm

instantiate required variables (boolean array to track visited cells, starting coordinates, total wall count)
as we perform backtracking, we keep track of the number of cells we have seen, which starts at the number of walls we counted
stopping conditions for backtracking
  first, check if coordinates are out of bounds,
  next, check if the cell has been visited or is a wall,
  lastly, check if it is the destination cell
    return 1 if the sum of walls and traversed cells equals the total number of cells, else 0
increase the count of seen cells
mark this cell as visited on this path
perform backtracking in all four orthogonal directions
before returning the total number of paths, mark this cell as unvisited so future paths may enter the cell again
