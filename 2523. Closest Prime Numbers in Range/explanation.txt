prime number algorithm: sieve of eratosthenes

main idea:
instead of computing if each number if is a prime, we instantiate a boolean array of numbers from 1 to right
when we traverse from 2 to right,
  we check if the boolean value at the current number is marked as a multiple of a previously encountered prime
  if it is not marked as a multiple,
    it is a prime
    for every multiple of this prime after the prime, to the right most value, we mark all those values as multiples
    check if this number is within the range of left < i < right
    if it is, compute the difference and check with the smallest difference encountered and adjust result accordingly
