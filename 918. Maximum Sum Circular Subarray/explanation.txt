modified kadane's algorithm

two cases to care for
1. normal case where max subarray lies within index 0 to n - 1
    - use normal kadane's algorithm
    - keep track of a current max and a max sum subarray value
2. extra case where max subarray involves the wrap around
    - the max subarray that wraps around can be represented with the total sum - minimum sum subarray
    - keep track of a current min and a min sum subarray value
