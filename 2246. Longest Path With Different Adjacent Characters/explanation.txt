instead of going from parent to children, start from all children to ensure we do not miss any nodes
inDegrees array to find all leaf nodes
start queue from leaf nodes
every time we travel to a node, decrement the in degree of its parent
if the parent finally has a 0 in degree, it is like a leaf node now, append to queue
    note: ignore node 0 since it has no parent (i.e. parent[0] = -1)
longest path from the current child is the sum of its longest path and its parent's longest path
longest path for the parent is either its current longest path or the child's longest path + 1
    note: update result first if not you might double count the child's path twice
