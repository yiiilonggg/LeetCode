two pointers, a pointer to the maximum step you can go to (high) and a pointer to where you currently are (curr)
continue traversing the array as long as you have steps to take (curr <= high)
at each index, check if there is a new high (high = max(high, curr + nums[curr])
if you can already reach the end of the array, return true
if you end the while loop without returning true, means the high is not at the end of the array and return false
